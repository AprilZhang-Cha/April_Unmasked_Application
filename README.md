# react-native blog

You will be making a react-native app that simulates a blog on a single screen. The functionality is demonstrated in the included video, and additional notes and requirement specifications are listed below. If you have any questions, please reach out to help@unmaskedproject.com.

## Requirements
1. The app must be written in react-native, preferably vanilla react-native, but if you are more comfortable with expo that's fine. The app should run on iOS and Android, but if you don't have an Apple computer just Android is fine.
2. The app must support functionality to create, edit, and delete posts as demonstrated in the video.
3. The initial posts must be sourced from the included json file.
4. The app must use an external icon library for the delete and edit icons, I used [`react-native-vector-icons`](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons), but you can use whatever.
5. The styling doesn't have to match the video but it should be presentable.
6. You are free to structure the code and components however you like.

## Notes
1. Test out the app on various phone models and screen sizes. Does everything still look good and work correctly?
2. Be careful implementing the edit functionality, it can be tricky. What happens when someone deletes another post in the list while they're making an edit? What if they delete the post they're currently editing?
3. Good code is clean code. Do you have any linting errors or react-native warnings?
